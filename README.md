## Basic information

This project contains a machine learning model trained on a [dataset obtained from
Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch).
The dataset is balanced, which allowed us to use simple accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.

Before training,
a preliminary [exploratory analysis was conducted](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandrtinekov/sbert-suicide-watch).

## Preprocessing & Feature extraction
The dataset consists of natural text, which includes typos, elongated words like "soooooo sory", emoticons,
self-censorship such as "you s!ck", and word concatenations like "STOP|STOP|STOP". To handle this,
a preprocessing step was applied to clean the text
(
[here](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/blob/main/src/transformers/sentece_splitter.py)
and
[here](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/blob/main/src/util/typos_processor.py)
).

In addition,
[several features were engineered](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/blob/main/src/transformers/features_extractor.py),
including the percentage of uppercase letters, ratio of exclamation and question marks to the number of sentences,
presence and count of self-censorship, text length, number of sentences, and number of individual emoticons.
After evaluating
[multiple approaches](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/blob/main/src/transformers/feature_selector.py),
the most informative features were selected and integrated into the dataset.

## Training
[Training was performed](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandrtinekov/upload-to-github-example) on a GPU in Kaggle.
SBERT sentence transformer was used to vectorize preprocessed text and XGBoost to create a classifier
based on vectors and extra features from previous step.

Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Optuna and 3 fold cross validation.
The final model achieved approximately 95% accuracy on validation data

## CI/CD
A [Docker container was built](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/blob/main/Dockerfile)
containing all necessary dependencies, and it is used for all subsequent steps. For quality assurance,
[pytest runs inside the Docker](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml)
container on every commit to the main branch, covering the core functionality of the project.
The unit tests are available [in tests folder](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/tree/main/tests).

[Deployment to Hugging Face](https://github.com/Tamplier/nlp_suicide_watch/blob/main/.github/workflows/hugging_face_deploy.yml)
is handled via GitHub Actions. The deployment is manually triggered and blocked if any tests fail,
ensuring only verified versions are released.

## Production
The Docker image size is approximately 3 GB, and the average RAM usage under normal conditions is around 2.4 GB.
Since this is an educational, non-commercial project, one of the key goals was to minimize hosting costs.
However, due to the inclusion of large machine learning models and dependencies such as SciPy, Torch, and XGBoost,
the memory requirements increased significantly.

Given these constraints, finding a free or low-cost hosting option was challenging.
As a result, Hugging Face Spaces was chosen as the production environment.
The project is currently deployed on this platform and can be accessed here:
